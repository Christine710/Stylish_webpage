                <p>Baking bread is one of the most fulfilling things you can do. The smell of fresh bread and the taste of a warm slice of fresh bread is the best!
                </p>
                <p>The recipe for No Knead Bread with yeast in getting more and more popular. It is an easy recipe, in which you mix together some flour, water
                    and a small amount of yeast before you go to bed. Overnight the yeast will start to ferment the flour and to create bubbles. At the same time
                    gluten will develop and after a time period of about 12 hours the dough is ready to be baked without any kneading. Hence the name; no knead bread.
                </p>
                <p>The recipes that are known that use a sourdough starter are a bit more complex and take a regular stretch and fold period to develop the gluten.
                    Baking a sourdough bread would be taking a lot of our time. But the taste of the sourdough gives an extra flavor to the bread.
                </p>
                <p>We wanted to combine the easy no knead recipe and the sourdough recipe. We have been experimenting with this and for now we can present you our
                    recipe so far. The note we will have to make is that the dough reacts different every time to influences such as warmth, time, the sourdough
                    starter or different types of flour. The recipe we present is the recipe we generally use to bake our bread, but we will also watch the
                    development and let the dough rise for a bit longer or shorter if it needs that. You will develop this feeling with time.

                <p>21.00 -- Mix the water and the Sourdough starter together in a big bowl. Add the flour and the salt next. Mix it roughly together but make sure
                    there is no flour ‘dry’ anymore. Cover the bowl with a lid or with some clean wrap. Set it somewhere overnight.
                </p>
                <p>09.00 -- If everything is okay, the dough should have risen a bit. Now you will give the dough a stretch and fold. Make your hands wet. Grab the
                    dough at one side, pull it out as far as you can without ripping it. And than fold it over. Turn the bowl 90 degrees and repeat. Repeat for a
                    couple of times until the dough holds his shape. With this technique you are helping to develop the gluten.
                </p>
                <p>10.00 -- Repeat the stretch and folds again.
                </p>
                <p>11.00 -- If all is well the dough becomes more firm, but it will rise. The gluten that have formed in the dough are keeping the air, that the
                    sourdough starter produces, trapped.Time to shape the dough. Get a rising basket, or if you don’t have one a bowl lined with a clean tea cloth,
                    and flour it thoroughly. Put some flour on the kitchen counter and take the dough out of the bowl. Stretch the dough out in a square. Fold the
                    dough over it self, just like the stretch and folds. Wit this you will create a bit of surface tension on the outside of the dough.Then turn
                    over the dough so that the unfolded surface is on top. Cup your hand on one side of the dough and pull the dough towards you. The dough will
                    form a nice smooth ball. There are a lot of youtube tutorials on how you could shape your dough. We advice you to take a look at this
                    <a href="https://www.weekendbakery.com/posts/video-shaping-a-boule/">one</a>.
                    Put the dough in the rising basket with the seam side up. Put some flour on top of it and cover it with a towel. Preheat your oven at 250
                    degrees with your Dutch oven already in.
                </p>
                <p>12.00 -- The dough should have risen a bit and is ready for baking. Take the Dutch oven out of the oven. Take your dough and flip the dough
                    on to your hand. Carefully place the dough into the pan, be carefully, because the pan is really hot. Take a sharp knife and make a slice of
                    0.5 cm deep in the dough. Put the lid back on and place the pan in the oven again. The reason why you use a Dutch oven for this is that the
                    steam that will come out of the bread gets trapped in the pan, this prevents a crust from forming in a to early stage. In this way the air in
                    the bread can expand and the bread will get an oven spring.
                    Bake it for 30 minutes with the lid on. After 30 minutes remove the lid and turn down the oven to 220 degrees. Bake the bread for another 15
                    minutes with the lid of, now the crust will form.
                </p>
                <p>After this time you can take the bread out of the oven. Leave it to cool for at least an hour, this allows the moist to stay in the bread. In
                    this way you can enjoy your bread for a few days longer. If you can’t wait, you can also eat it immediately!
                </p>
                <p>We like to double the amount of dough and bake two breads. If you also want to do that, put one of portions of dough in the fridge for an hour
                    directly after you shaped the bread. This will prevent it from over proofing. If you’ve put the first bread in the oven, you can take the other
                    one out of the fridge again.
                </p>
                <p>Enjoy your bread!</p>
